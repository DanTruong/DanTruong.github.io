Hello, my name is Dan Truong and I am an IT support tech based out of Central New York. I am also a grad student in the Biomedical and Health Informatics program at SUNY Oswego. Outside of work and school, I like to work on projects related to web design and development, as well as data analytics.

On the web development end, I've done work with the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, JSON, REST, Markdown and Jekyll (this site is powered on it). On the data analytics end, I've worked with: R, Minitab, SPSS, R Markdown and Microsoft Excel. My GitHub profile can attest to some of these skills listed.

When I'm not busy working on professional projects, I normally partake in computer or video gaming. I'll normally be found trying (and failing) to be good at Team Fortress 2, Battlefield 1 and Left 4 Dead. I also like to take PC games and run them on the lowest possible hardware, mainly for technical curiosity in seeing what's the lowest we can go (as well as for kicks). Outside of the technical realm, I like to travel on road trips around the U.S.
