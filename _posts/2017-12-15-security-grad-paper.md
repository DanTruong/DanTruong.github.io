While working on my Masters Degree in Biomedical and Health Informatics, I took a class on Information Assurance. The course dealt with cybersecurity topics and stressed the amount of scrutiny that goes into keeping medical and financial data safe. It was a challenging, but very fun course; topics involved governance, compliance, theoretical attacks, motive-opportunity-method, programming design flaws and many more. When I wrote a final paper for the class, it dealt with contemporary methods for securing data transmissions. I used electronic medical data and eCommerce as the subjects of what to protect against. The paper can be read below or via this [link](https://github.com/DanTruong/dantruong.github.io/raw/master/etc/Methods%20for%20Securing%20Data%20Transmission.pdf).
