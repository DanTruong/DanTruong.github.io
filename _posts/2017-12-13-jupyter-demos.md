I've been trying out Jupyter to perform statistical experiments with, as well as sharing the code to allow for reproducible research. Jupyter is an interactive web app (ran locally) that allows for a developer to write a report, while running the code within the report. It makes it so that the developer doesn't need to switch back-and-forth between their document editor and IDE for copying/pasting their program results. The analyses can be run within the document themselves. 

What I like about Jupyter is how I can run snippets of code and paste their results (as well as my commentary) into a LaTeX-powered PDF file. Jupyter also supports exporting documents as an HTML document or in Markdown format. I did an example document that demonstrated hypothesis testing on a small data population. As such, libraries such as scipy and math were imported and utilized. The code and finished document can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/DanTruong/Jupyter-Notebook-Demo).
