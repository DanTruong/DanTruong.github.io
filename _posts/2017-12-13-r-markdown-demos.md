In addition to Jupyter, I've also been playing with R Markdown for writing up data analytics reports with. R Markdown is an authoring framework that allows for the union of Markdown documents and R code together (there's also support for other languages such as Python, SQL and JavaScript). Like with Jupyter, developers don't need to constantly swap between their word processor and IDE; the code can be processed alongside the document.

A few examples were included with the demo. They involve reading in outside data and generating graphs from them. In addition, these documents can be exported to straight Markdown or HTML documents. THe code for example documents can be found [here](https://github.com/DanTruong/R-Markdown-Demos).
